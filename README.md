Duel
====

Star Duel is a remake of the classic game Duel! v2.0 by Guy Gervais which was programmed for Windows 3.1
The goal is to make an improved game built ontop of Javascript and HTML5. Mobile game development ideas are also in contemplation.


What is it?
-----------
It is a space battle game wherewhich one commands their own ship, with the ability to rotate it and use thrusters. The goal is simply to elminate the opponent who will have an identical ship. Suns placed in the map will pull objects into them and change the trajectory of bullets as well as act as obstacles for ships.

Timeline
-----------
I first plan to implement a basic expandable game with a single simple map and only local play.
The second step will be to create a map editor.
The third step will be to add in the ability to load local maps.
The fourth step will be to add enemy AI.
The final step will be to add network support.
